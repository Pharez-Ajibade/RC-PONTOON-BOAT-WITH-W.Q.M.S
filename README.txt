Water Vessel: A DIY Remote-Controlled Water Quality Monitor
Overview

This repository contains the design files and code for a DIY remote-controlled water vessel equipped with a water quality monitoring system. The vessel is primarily constructed using PVC pipes and powered by brushless motors. It utilizes an Arduino-based system for remote control and an ESP32 for water quality data collection and transmission to the Blynk app.

Key Features

Remote Control: Arduino-based transmitter and receiver for precise control.
Water Quality Monitoring: TDS, turbidity, and temperature sensors for real-time water quality data.
Buoyant Design: PVC pipe-based pontoon structure for reliable flotation.
Brushless Motors: Powerful and efficient propulsion.
Blynk Integration: Real-time data visualization and control.
